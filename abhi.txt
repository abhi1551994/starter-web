Git should push up all your changes that you have on your local system

up to the remote repository. So, at the bottom, we can see that it confirms

that it pushed the changes to my copy of the "starter-web" Git repository on GitHub.

It also tells me which commits were involved;

so, basically, it pushed the commit "5c05047" up to "ba5b0f0",

which is also master to master, so my local master to my remote master.

Well, let's go see if that actually happened. So let's go back to our browser,


Hello good morning
